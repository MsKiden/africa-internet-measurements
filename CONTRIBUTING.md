# Contributing to the Africa Internet Measurements Project

Thank you once again for your interest in joining this project! 👏🏾 🎊 🎉

The [Broadband Performance and Internet Measurements project](https://github.com/MsKiden/africa-internet-measurements) aims to build a portal and work with researchers to collect and analyse Internet measurements data so that regulators and policy makers can develop policy that will help Internet Service Providers to improve service delivery and end users to make informed choices. Please see more information in the project [README.md](https://github.com/MsKiden/africa-internet-measurements/blob/master/README.md). 

This document (CONTRIBUTING.md) is a set of guidelines for contributing to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/MsKiden/africa-internet-measurements). These are guidelines, not rules, to make it easy for anyone to get involved.

## Participant guidelines
Please take a look at the project [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MsKiden/africa-internet-measurements/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which outlines our expectations for participants within the project. 

## What we are working on
To get started, take a look at the issues in our [milestones](https://github.com/MsKiden/africa-internet-measurements/projects/1). Find an interesting issue to contribute to. 

Since many people use the Internet, anyone can be part of the project. 
+ End users can contribute by downloading one of the many speed test applications and testing their broadband speeds. I am currently working with Netradar, SpeedChecker, Princeton University’s Speed Test. These vendors have generously agreed to provide raw data to Research ICT Africa, containing anonymous tests conducted in Africa for the period 2013 - 2018. Network engineers are also welcome to conduct tests on their networks and share findings. 
+	Researchers can help with finding relevant documentation about the subject matter, especially in the region. This includes journals, articles, publications, portals, and other case studies that we can learn from.
+ Data visualisation experts can help interpret the data in a way that makes sense to different audiences: end users, regulators, service providers. Maps, graphs, charts are preferable, but other tools are welcome. 
+ Open data experts or web designers can give guidance on how to develop an interactive and open data portal that will contain this information. Take a look at [this presentation](https://researchictafrica.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AIS18_performance-panel-vFinal-Draft.pdf) to see some sample results. 
+ Anyone interested in Internet measurements is welcome to give guidance or work with us to build a community of people interested in the subject and to develop a solution. 


## How to submit changes
Once you have identified an issue that you would like to contribute to, please feel free to make a change to the project repository! To do this,
